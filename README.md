# box #


## Intro ##


This package contains a multi-robot planning system for box pushing.
It will create a waypoint abstraction of the world and use centralized planning algorithms to push boxes to their goal destination.
There are two planning approaches: 
* An internal C++ optimal planner based on A*.
* An exterminal PDDL-compatible general planner interface.

Using the external planner requires installing and configuring the external planner, and creating the appropriate script under /scripts.

Execution is hierarchical. A commander node will plan and send plan steps one by one to each robot's supervisor node.
The supervisor node will oversee the step execution for its robot and report back to the commander node.
The commander's plan is kept in the commander's machine and only the current step is broadcast to the network. 





## Basic Install ##

Creat models:

```roscd box/models  ```

```create-all.sh  ```

Run catkin_make at the workspace root.


## Example Usage (Turtlebot Gazebo) ##

###### On the "Robot 0" machine:

```export ROBOT_INITIAL_POSE="-y 0.5" ```

```roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch world_file:=$(rospack find box)/worlds/maze_01.world ```

```roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo amcl_demo.launch map_file:=$(rospack find box)/maps/maze_01.yaml initial_pose_y:=0.5 ```

```rosrun box execution_supervisor.sh gil@deskhp:Public 0 ```


###### On the "Robot 1" machine:

```export ROBOT_INITIAL_POSE="-y -0.5" ```

```roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch world_file:=$(rospack find box)/worlds/maze_01.world ```

```roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo amcl_demo.launch map_file:=$(rospack find box)/maps/maze_01.yaml initial_pose_y:=-0.5 ```

```rosrun box execution_supervisor.sh gil@deskhp:Public 1 ```


###### On the "Planner" machine:

```rosrun box execution_commander.sh 2 "$(rospack find box)/maps/maze_01.yaml" ```

Example box start positions:

```1183 1047 876 ```

Example box end positions:

```1225 1219 707 ```





## Example Usage (Real Turtlebot) ##


###### On the "Robot 0" machine:

```roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch ```

```roslaunch turtlebot_navigation amcl_demo.launch map_file:=$(rospack find box)/maps/printer.yaml ```

```rosrun box execution_supervisor.sh gil@deskhp:Public 0 ```


###### On the "Robot 1" machine:

```roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch ```

```roslaunch turtlebot_navigation amcl_demo.launch map_file:=$(rospack find box)/maps/printer.yaml ```

```rosrun box execution_supervisor.sh gil@deskhp:Public 1 ```


###### On the "Planner" machine:

```rosrun box execution_commander.sh 2 "$(rospack find box)/maps/printer.yaml" ```




## Example Usage (Real Pioneer) ##


###### On the "Robot 0" machine:

```roslaunch pioneer localization.launch map_name:=$(rospack find pioneer)/maps/printer.yaml```

```rosrun box execution_supervisor.sh gil@laptop:Public 0 ```


###### On the "Robot 1" machine:

```roslaunch pioneer localization.launch map_name:=$(rospack find pioneer)/maps/printer.yaml```

```rosrun box execution_supervisor.sh gil@laptop:Public 1 ```


###### On the "Planner" machine:

```rosrun box execution_commander.sh 2 "$(rospack find pioneer)/maps/printer.yaml" ```
